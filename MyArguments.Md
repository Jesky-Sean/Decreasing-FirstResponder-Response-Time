KISS. : we are doing all of this now, but, in this new way - its an optimized system design for all of us to use, instead of the current system, we optimize for lives saved, which happens to optimize the rest.. 

It’s simple.  All the rules we use now, add the FR lights, when the system is active, merge within two intersections if a civilian, until first responder lighting system is deactivated, only after the next intersection which it’s off (ensures no accidental collisions with FRs during their operation of the system, then civilians can simply and easily merge back, if all FRLS are active across all lanes in an intersection, those cars along those lanes must remain stationary - otherwise civilians should continue as they usually would after merging until first responders pass them, and the FRLS is deactivated behind them after each intersection passed, afterwords, traffic resumes as usual, safer for everyone, with lives saved.  

Unless I’m missing something - this guarantees safety and efficiency for everyone on the road - civilians know where they stand and what to do and when to do it, allowing faster travel by our first responders, thereby leading them to save lives and use those freedom horses all at once. 

Biggest issues are: Unless someone merges when the system is active into an active lane, and causes a severe and sudden accident with our FRs 

or a FR can’t somehow drive efficiently in these optimal conditions to their destinations (which.. common. Anyone could do that so that’s not a reason to not do it, the volume of lives saved must have a good reason to be ignored)

the fact most roads are grids without major corners (some country’s like England may have adaption issues for speed here when it comes to their corners) it’s as if we are already set up for such a system, just needed the invention. 

Little infrastructure cost and or changes, even if adding buffer lines to be used to give more room to the now by citizens if people are worried about the now faster first responders (even though it’s a logical fallacy, they’ve already drove fast, just traffic often held them up in between their high speeds), faster first responders, is still minuscule in terms of efficiency and lives saved. 

And the fact is, the system turns off directly behind them FRs, so the longest wait is for the people at the end of the FR route, while the beginning of the route has very little impact. In addition, FR usually are within a range distributed to achieve faster response times, meaning, more of often than not, the system won’t remain active for long most the time anyways if used. 

And lastly — fuck mass shooters and terrorist - this is just as much a weapon against them as it is a tool for us.

(this video displays an edge case, or three that need to be addressed, though again not significant, but still need to be addressed for proper functionality)



if my system were in place, the FRs dont have to worry about lane changes, nor someone merging into his lane, as the location of FRs destinations are most often static locations, not high speed chases or the like, when watching this or other videos related, you can clearly see, if the officer didnt have to worry about traffic merging into their lanes or worry about switching lanes, almost no accidents would ever occur, you ever try to pass someone in the hallway snd you both keep picking the same direction? well think about that at high speeds, we can easily ensure that such events almost never happen, and we can ensure better traffic and responce times during emergencies. also, why not. what do we have to loose by reducing responce times in such a simple and easy way. think of it, each of these videos would maybe be 1/4th as long with the addition of safty for everyone on the road at the time of its activation. 

there may be a few kinks to work out, but in all, it simulates very well and has a 99.9% chance to reduce responce times significatly - everyone gets an ground-based-airlift for a serious emergencys. 

whats cool regardless, the system we have now is the same exact thing, everything we have now and do now, its the same exact thing but optimized with the spirt of the C++ programming language culture of optimization.
