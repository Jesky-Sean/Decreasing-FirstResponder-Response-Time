fucking hate crimes begin again now im working on this again, fuck everyone.  

Draft - pre-release white paper. i came up with this for someone: [https://github.com/Jesky-Sean/Decreasing-FirstResponder-Response-Time/blob/main/White%20Paper%20-%20A%20Best%20Solution_R.docx](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jesky-Sean/Decreasing-FirstResponder-Response-Time/refs/heads/main/White%20Paper%20-%20A%20Best%20Solution_R.docx) 
    (A Best Solution. by, sean m jesky, as a word document). 
    
    but ive found out that person is "unintrested in me" and i some
    rather hurtful other things (i dont belive it because i didnt hear
    it from her, but its my fault i used what i thought what was
    her friends giving me hints to what she was thinking, omg was i dumb.
    im dumb... thought id hear from them eventually, but now i guess that
    was why :( this idea was dedicated for them -and created for them and us
    and the future ithought at the time i created it.
    now it feels like im looked at in disgust like i did something
    horrible and no one will tell me. 
    
    *(read last paragraph) i wish i could just undo what i did because 
    im still in love but now when i work on this idea its with heartbreak,
    no answers and im hurting cant eat, sleep, or even think because
    i thought she was the one in all regards. i cant even explain it even now.

    this image shows basic rules of how it would work in action on a whiteboard. (corrected, - and added extra notes)


here i propose a valid and effective means of decreasing responce times for first responders to save lives on the order of 10,000 a year without hindering traffic flow by no more than 1/10th of the pre-existing triffic flow conditions of the area in which its active, only a simple, temporary dynamic shifting of lanes by citizen drivers, until the system has been turned off behind the first responders after which civilian drivers can returned back to their original lane if they wish. results in no traffic being held up for long, if ar all, and first responders can get to their destination faster than ever before, safely as well, its a group effort without any effort for us all to save the lives of others, and in record time too, enough to make a real difference.

    these two images show concept art of how it could be implemented if we
    redesgined traffic lights, and we could just embedd first responder
    lights within traffic lights to enable this effect required to alert drivers,
    to merge into a new lane or come to a stop at a intersection as required 
    based off first responders requirements based off their route, or simply
    attached underneath existing traffic lights and enabled by existing power source. 

granted, this system of emergency lights attached to traffic light posts, or other fixtures - its pretty easy to set up and idk, it could be implemented like ten tomorrows from now if we wanted really.. if they hired someone whos like... the best at this stuff..

suggestions:

  mark streets with this system in place, so when people turn onto these streets they cant say they were surprised or say they had no idea, etc. 
  late merging is an issue i can foresee being an issue as well, waiting till the last moment to merge, when this needs to happen ASAP.  placing, another issue is cars that pull into multipul lanes, like large trucks or even regular cars, when trying to get into a lane without the room for such a turn-in. 
  in bottle necks that hinder response times like busy streets, popular areas, etc. the places that cause the most issues. 

maybe TODO's:

  -Powerpoint - How, When, Step by Step.
   
    -Q&A from professionals.
    -BETA testing propositions and where (Military bases might be the best place to test this solution to Faster Responce times, or other citys within citys that have a rather static number cars a day and can be kept as a good test enviroment.)
    -Edge cases & solutions.
    -possible effects on traffic stability.
    -how to incentivise civilian's to follow these rules (id suggest using insurance companies, 
        if they get a photo of their licences from the first responders, a monitary fine should be sufficent, and a reward if otherwise, in this way it can be a temporary incentive until people adapt

my nighbors tried to stop me from being who i was, they tried to stop me from helping others, they tried their hardest - i never give up on my dreams, i promise this dream above will be a reality and we will save lives due to it with minimal effort. 

(how i hope its used) possible high level uses include:

    state/federal O/P/A killers. 
   
    amber alerts. 
   
    mass(ive) (loosers who do) shootings. 
   
    Presendial motorcades. 
   
    saving grandma (no matter the sevarity, if its a good grandma who is raising the kids, it better be use 100% of the time)
   
    containment of pathological/toxicalogical/radiological/or gov. training... for these events. 
    
    fires or fires not caused by humans
    
    tornados/hurricanes/cyclones (oh we dont have those, your country might, maybe come here and we provide better protection...) or other natural disasters.  
    
    [adding more later]
 
   
   
   

   
   



   (no one will be able to say they never helped the cops, predident, feds, or their fellow man/or women, to me just for that laugh, it would be worth it - that would be really funny right? we all do something good, for the first time in society we all all doing something good for everyone else with no cost or payment to the helpers and helpies, thats some real hippy stuff ðŸ˜‚. 
   
   
   
   (never for VIPs please!
   
   i mean, just me so i can see how it works....)



    as soon as i start my work trying to help others and live my life.
    fuck everyone. i have no one and i guess its a good thing everyone
    hates me and no one has ever stoped them (neighbors and maintence
    workers engaged in hate crimes against me). fml. 
    
    sidenote - fuck roomers and gossip, every time someone interfears 
    or otherwise sabatages my life not her one friend with the coffee
    test, and orher questions, shes legit looking out for the women i
    fell in love with and i know she cares about her wellbeing and
    happynes - i would bet my life on that truth.) she was my one true
    love who inspired this and my prints, and ill never get another chance now. 
    
    if anyone asks me a question i will answer it truthfully, 
    but no one ever asks, execpt for one person ("dont you ever get 
    board just sitting here doing nothing") and that was the only time, 
    every other time no one asks me anything
    ill hear something and be like wtf who came up with that!?!?!? 
    and it hurts me that it gets belived. 
    in addition when im in pain i will write a bunch of shit (bad stuff, 
    really bad stuff that in the moment you have no control of what you say,
    again unless youve been tortured for as long as i have, your hurting
    me by making stuff up just as much as my torturers, fuck you - and its
    a outlet, a known and effective coping mech. and it works. and saved my life
    along with taylor swift songs and other happy music like motly crue,
    greenday and and and.  
    
    if you were being affected by hate crimes that caused you severe pain and you 
    are someone like me, who cant hurt anyone due to personal beleifs, 
    then youd have to find a way to express your fustration,
    and my way is to write - 

    it means nothing but it helps me live another day when i write nonsence 
    (word vomit) unless you ask me about it you wont understand it. but,
    using what i write! out of context of what im experiencing from hate crime.
    intentionally misrepresenting who i am based off what helped me 
    survive torture. duck off.
    torture for over 1 year in capativity caused me to have to write to survive,
    then its used against me, as it has many times before by my torturers 
    now a jelly older women ive been told. now im scared for her if they 
    hang out because idk if she knows what think i know. 
    why wont anyone just take the time to understand me. 
    i never lie if im asked a direct question and id give my life to
    protect others, there is even proof of that when i was in a fight
    with my dog against two vicious pits who wanted to tear him open.
    i dont and never will give up to help others. 


    i theorize; someone got involved in my life and made shit up about 
    me or something most likley without context or truth of what i was
    going through at home,
    in addition, someone older was pretending to be my friend to learn 
    about her,to get to me (sounds fucking crazy unless you know what i know)
    then did this shit and used this info i told her about her to become
    her friend and that is my best guess. in additon, i stayed the night
    for a few days, and after she tried to make a few moves on me and i dint
    want it, she said "i know your going to treat [] like a princess" then a
    few days later i hear shes saying im not able to live on my own or take
    care of my self. fuck you. i wake up at 3am, make my bed, twke a shower,
    work out and then study and i did that nonstop for years, wtf is wrong
    with people.
    Then she gives me a hug and she seriously presses herself against me,
    you have no clue what ive done or howive lived and what i went through,
    and you are a manipulator of the highest cal. and, three days
    after the attempted kiss oe so, she knew every detail and used that
    to try and get me up. whos playing me and why? ill only ever want
    one women and its no one else. but bescauss she knew all these little
    details i thought my women said somethung and it waz another test
    because how much she knew, and what to say. 
    
    i know the women of my dreams didnt report me because she would have
    just said it as it was,  shes not thay type of girl (as you all called her) 
    shes a women, and no one can tell me differet, shes a good women who
    didnt do anything wrong, and you all interfeared with her and me and
    made it seem like shes incapable or dumb. no you all are dumb,
    shes brilliant and will surpas me anyday one day, i did and i apperently
    always will be the problem, and ill never escape and have a real life.
