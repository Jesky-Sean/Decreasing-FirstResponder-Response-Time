no one in this country, not once offerend me sanctuary. ehoever does goes everything. its really that simple. i dont want anythin else anymore. i dont want to live i dont want my work i dont want a relationshsip with anyone i dont want anything but my death and/or this to end (honestly even if it ends ill still probl killmyseld anyways.  so it hardly matters.) being 100% alone makes these decisions easier. if you doubt their worth of 100m to billions of dollars i can prove it. i dont want anything but them to be stoped. you can kill me after too because i dont want my american dream anymore. im very sure about this. and im very ready to die.
