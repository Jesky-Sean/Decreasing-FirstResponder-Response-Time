Draft - pre-release white paper. i came up with this for someone, but ive found out that person is "unintrested in me and ..." this idea was dedicated for them until someone got involved in my life and made shit up about me or something most likley without context or truth of what i was going through at home, someone older was pretending to be my friend to learn about her then did this shit and used this info i told her about her to become her friend and that is my best guess. (read last paragraph) i wish i could just undo what i did because im still in love but now when i work on this idea its with heartbreak.

*this image shows basic rules of how it would work in action on a whiteboard (error, farthest set of lights north of second set of vertical lane lines from the left, should be placed in the lane directly next to it)

here i propose a valid and effective means of decreasing responce times for first responders to save lives on the order of 10,000 a year without hindering traffic flow by no more than 1/10th of the pre-existing triffic flow conditions of the area in which its active, only a simple, temporary dynamic shifting of lanes by citizen drivers, until the system has been turned off behind the first responders after which civilian drivers can returned back to their original lane if they wish. results in no traffic being held up for long, if ar all, and first responders can get to their destination faster than ever before, safely as well, its a group effort without any effort for us all to save the lives of others, and in record time too, enough to make a real difference .

*these two images show concept art of how it could be implemented if we redesgined traffic lights, and we could just embedd first responder lights within traffic lights to enable this effect required to alert drivers, or simply attached underneath existing traffic lights and enabled by existing power source. 


needs a bit of work, for desgining the system is rather simple but thinking is still very difficult in these conditions, but the core is there, i just had to start. but the AI says its pretty good right now, so ill take its pointers and write a few more things.

granted, this system of emergency lights attached to traffic light posts, or other fixtures - its pretty easy to set up and idk, it could be implemented like ten tomorrows from now if we wanted really.. if they hired someone whos like... the best at this stuff..

still working on bits here and there for the paper but people are vultures sometimes, and i really want something more than ive ever wanted before in my life, so had to take this approach and publish as fast as i could in any way i could - now once complete or to the best of my ability till i can think again in good conditions, ill send it off to everyone everywhere in this country.
 
i should just post all my notes on this that i did as well, but in my current living conditions im suprised i did this much or could even think of this basic idea.*


suggestions:

  mark streets with this system in place, so when people turn onto these streets they cant say they were surprised or say they had no idea, etc. 
  late merging is an issue i can foresee being an issue as well, waiting till the last moment to merge, when this needs to happen ASAP.  placing 
  in bottle necks that hinder response times like busy streets, popular areas, etc. the places that cause the most issues. 

maybe TODO's:

  -Powerpoint - How, When, Step by Step.
   
    -Q&A from professionals.
    -BETA testing propositions and where (Military bases might be the best place to test this solution to Faster Responce times, or other citys within citys that have a rather static number cars a day and can be kept as a good test enviroment.)
    -Edge cases & solutions.
    -possible effects on traffic stability.
    -how to incentivise civilian's to follow these rules (id suggest using insurance companies, 
        if they get a photo of their licences from the first responders, a monitary fine should be sufficent, and a reward if otherwise, in this way it can be a temporary incentive until people adapt

my nighbors tried to stop me from being who i was, they tried to stop me from helping others, they tried their hardest - i never give up on my dreams, i promise this dream above will be a reality and we will save lives due to it with minimal effort. 

(how i hope its used) possible high level uses include:

    state/federal O/P/A killers. 
   
    amber alerts. 
   
    mass(ive) (loosers who do) shootings. 
   
    Presendial motorcades. 
   
    saving grandma (no matter the sevarity, if its a good grandma who is raising the kids, it better be use 100% of the time)
   
    containment of pathological/toxicalogical/radiological/or gov. training... for these events. 
    
    fires or fires not caused by humans
    
    tornados/hurricanes/cyclones (oh we dont have those, your country might, maybe come here and we provide better protection...) or other natural disasters.  
    
    [adding more later]
 
   
   
   

   
   



   (no one will be able to say they never helped the cops, predident, feds, or their fellow man/or women, to me just for that laugh, it would be worth it - that would be really funny right? we all do something good, for the first time in society we all all doing something good for everyone else with no cost or payment to the helpers and helpies, thats some real hippy stuff ðŸ˜‚. 
   
   
   
   (never for VIPs please!
   
   i mean, just me so i can see how it works....)



------
as soon as i start my work trying to help others and live my life. fuck everyone. i have no one and i guess its a good thing everyone hates me and no one has ever stoped them (neighbors and maintence workers engaged in hate crimes against me). fml. and sidenote - fuck roomers and gossip, every time someone interfears or otherwise sabatages my life because they want me and i dont want them or something along those dumb and stupid lines. if anyone asks me a question i will answer it truthfully, but no one ever asks, execpt for one person ("dont you ever get board just sitting here doing nothing") and that was the only time, every other time no one asks me anything but ill hear something and be like wtf who came up with that!?!?!? and it hurts me that it gets belived. when im in pain i will write a bunch of shit and its a outlet, if you were being affected by hate crimes that caused you severe pain and you are someone like me, who cant hurt anyone due to personal beleifs, then youd have to find a way to express your fustration, and my way is to write - it means nothing but it helps me live.
