Draft - pre-release white paper. i came up with this for someone, sorry again: [https://github.com/Jesky-Sean/Decreasing-FirstResponder-Response-Time/blob/main/White%20Paper%20-%20A%20Best%20Solution_R.docx](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jesky-Sean/Decreasing-FirstResponder-Response-Time/refs/heads/main/White%20Paper%20-%20A%20Best%20Solution_R.docx) 
    (A Best Solution. by, sean m jesky, as a word document).

    this image shows basic rules of how it would work in action on a whiteboard. (corrected, again, again, again - and added extra notes and better look)

    Rule #0: The FRLS (first responder lighting system) turns off after first
        responder(s) have passed the intersection(s) along their route(s).
        
    Rule #1: when active, and the FRLS is on. civilian drivers must merge into any
       inactive lane (anywhere the FRLS is not on and flashing). 
        
    Rule #2: when the FRLS is active across all lanes of a intersection, all cars
        within those lanes must remain stationary, and not move until rule #0 
        becomes true (when FRLS is off at that intersection), at which point 
        resume with regular traffic light system rules, as civilian drivers normally
        would.
       
    Rule #3: FRLS stays active until one intersection after the first
        responders destination. 

    RESULT: A temporay dynamic express lane for first responders to quickly arrive at
        their destination as to reduce casualitys that a reduction in time can
        produce, as the studies suggest is possible to save over 10,000 lives a
        year if we just reduce the responce time by one minute. we can all be apart
        of something great and there is nothing more we have to do but move left,
        right, or just a simple, temp. stop when we drive, and only for a few moments 
        of time. we, the people can all do something great for us all at no cost to 
        us all, together as a country. we can be a Utopiatarian society. we can
        achevie it if we try, together.

its easier to improve upon your provious work, than it is to improve upon nothing, its why ill put anything down even if its bad because that can be made better than, nothing created yet.  

*working on the flowchart right now, havent done one in a while so.. hopfully this goes better then this second later on in. i mean wow is this bad, but i know what to do to make it better.. idk im trying to show how what i do is a purely iterative process that anyone could do. 


here i propose a valid and effective means of decreasing responce times for first responders to save lives on the order of 10,000 a year without hindering traffic flow by no more than 1/10th of the pre-existing triffic flow conditions of the area in which its active, only a simple, temporary dynamic shifting of lanes by citizen drivers, until the system has been turned off behind the first responders after which civilian drivers can returned back to their original lane if they wish. results in no traffic being held up for long, if at all, and first responders can get to their destination faster than ever before, safely as well, its a group effort without any effort for us all to save the lives of others, and in record time too, enough to make a real difference.

    these two images show concept art of how it could be implemented if we
    redesgined traffic lights, and we could just embedd first responder
    lights within traffic lights to enable this effect required to alert drivers,
    to merge into a new lane or come to a stop at a intersection as required 
    based off first responders requirements based off their route, or simply
    attached underneath existing traffic lights and enabled by existing power source. 

granted, this system of emergency lights attached to traffic light posts, or other fixtures - its pretty easy to set up and idk, it could be implemented like ten tomorrows from now if we wanted really.. if they hired someone whos like... the best at this stuff..

suggestions:

  mark streets with this system in place, so when people turn onto these streets they cant say they were surprised or say they had no idea, etc. 
  late merging is an issue i can foresee being an issue as well, waiting till the last moment to merge, when this needs to happen ASAP.  placing, another issue is cars that pull into multipul lanes, like large trucks or even regular cars, when trying to get into a lane without the room for such a turn-in. 
  in bottle necks that hinder response times like busy streets, popular areas, etc. the places that cause the most issues. 

maybe TODO's:

  -Powerpoint - How, When, Step by Step.
   
    -Q&A from professionals.
    -BETA testing propositions and where (Military bases might be the best place to test this solution to Faster Responce times, or other citys within citys that have a rather static number cars a day and can be kept as a good test enviroment.)
    -Edge cases & solutions.
    -possible effects on traffic stability.
    -how to incentivise civilian's to follow these rules (id suggest using insurance companies, 
        if they get a photo of their licences from the first responders, a monitary fine should be sufficent, and a reward if otherwise, in this way it can be a temporary incentive until people adapt

my nighbors tried to stop me from being who i was, they tried to stop me from helping others, they tried their hardest - i never give up on my dreams, i promise this dream above will be a reality and we will save lives due to it with minimal effort. 

(how i hope its used) possible high level uses include:

    state/federal O/P/A killers. 
   
    amber alerts. 
   
    mass(ive) (loosers who do) shootings. 
   
    Presendial motorcades. 
   
    saving grandma (no matter the sevarity, if its a good grandma who is raising the kids, it better be use 100% of the time)
   
    containment of pathological/toxicalogical/radiological/or gov. training... for these events. 
    
    fires or fires not caused by humans
    
    tornados/hurricanes/cyclones (oh we dont have those, your country might, maybe come here and we provide better protection...) or other natural disasters.  
    
    [adding more later]
 
   
   
   

   
   



   (no one will be able to say they never helped the cops, predident, feds, or their fellow man/or women, to me just for that laugh, it would be worth it - that would be really funny right? we all do something good, for the first time in society we all all doing something good for everyone else with no cost or payment to the helpers and helpies, thats some real hippy stuff ðŸ˜‚. 
   
   
   
   (never for VIPs please!
   
   i mean, just me so i can see how it works....).
