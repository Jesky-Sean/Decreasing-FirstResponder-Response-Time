## Generalized use and uses Proposal

revised peoposal (spellcheck and rewritten.. well all the same words, in all its glory with some help)


Here I, Sean M. Jesky, propose a valid and effective means of decreasing response times for first responders to save lives on the order of 10,000/yr plus or minus.

But if we can decrease our nation’s first response time by just 3 minutes on average, we can bump up the amount of lives saved to 40,000-45,000 lives/yr saved.

~

This strategy occurs largely without any effort. The effect on traffic flow, if any, would be minimal, to no more than a slight decimal change of the pre-existing conditions. My hope is that it actually reduces average travel times on roads where emergency response delays occur due to reasons like congestion, poor road design, or other traffic and other - related issues.

~

This system creates a TDELFR (Temporary Dynamic Express Lane System for First Responders), activated by first responders and maintained through citizen drivers on designated roads along routes with an active system - who simply are required to merge into a lane within two intersections after the system’s activation in which the system is not active whichever lane they choose; unless all FRLS within a intersections lane are active, in which case, remain still until the system is inactive and resume normal traffic lighting rules. 

~

Additionally, the FRLS (First Responder Lighting System) would blink yellow alongside emergency lights to signal that the first responder just began their route, to civilians. Once the yellow light stops flashing, it signals to drivers that their merging time has near-ended, and be sure to do so before the next intersection.

~

In a batch-dispatching scenario (e.g., “all units in the area”), the first and last responders responding can connect their routes together, while the FR leading the tail-end closes the FRLS’s circuit behind the group, signaling to intersections behind them to resume regular traffic flow. 

meanwhile the FR's inbetween, just need to find an intersection that leads them to the active FRLS. 

~

This ensures that the lane remains open and clear (clear to the end of any traffic) for emergency responders within that batch responce - heading to their destination(s), whilst making room for others in the dispatch group, or those responding to the call.

~

This system stays active until first responders have passed, after which civilian drivers return to their original lanes. By organizing traffic this way, we enable faster source-to-destination times for responders.

~

Done properly, this system will safely organize traffic and save lives, with no real effort and/or time from civilians and pedestrians, just the same basic traffic rules everyone already follows, with equally simple and very few rules to add. 

~

With minimal effort, this collective action allows us to save lives and make a real difference as a nation. It’s a simple, yet powerful, way to contribute—we the people.

    Rule #0: The FRLS (first responder lighting system) turns off after first
        responder(s) have passed the intersection(s) along their route(s).
        
    Rule #1: when active, and the FRLS is on. civilian drivers must merge into any
       inactive lane (anywhere the FRLS is not on and flashing). 
        
    Rule #2: when the FRLS is active across all lanes of a intersection, all cars
        within those lanes must remain stationary, and not move until rule #0 
        becomes true (when FRLS is off at that intersection), at which point 
        resume with regular traffic light system rules, as civilian drivers normally
        would.
       
    Rule #3: FRLS stays active until one intersection after the first
        responders destination. 

    RESULT: A temporay dynamic express lane for first responders to quickly arrive at
        their destination as to reduce casualitys that a reduction in time can
        produce, as the studies suggest is possible to save over 10,000 lives a
        year if we just reduce the responce time by one minute. we can all be apart
        of something great and there is nothing more we have to do but move left,
        right, or just a simple, temp. stop when we drive, and only for a few moments 
        of time. we, the people can all do something great for us all at no cost to 
        us all, together as a country. we can be a Utopiatarian society. we can
        achevie it if we try, together.   

granted, this system of emergency lights attached to traffic light posts, or other fixtures - its pretty easy to set up and idk, it could be implemented like ten tomorrows from now if we wanted really.. if they hired someone whos like... the best at this stuff..

btw im creating this for the police /EMS and/or the DOT to operate, not for someone else to operate, idk about that, we dont need someone whos not ever saved a life to be involved in these decisions in real time where arguing about it being needed or not would be a burden on the system (perf. the ones dispatched control this feature as to prevent it not being used when it needs to be used, basically, them saying they are responding is enough to put responcability of proper use in their hands, if they can own and use a gun, this would be hardly above that responcability; in addition, i predict, that its use will make it easier to deescalate due to FR's arriving to people before things keep becoming more escalated; also hopfully arriving in that state makes things safter for FR's and purps. and vics. in the process. more time to assess means more time to save and help others (i know what im talking about in that last sentence only, so i know the rest would also be largly true.

im just getting started in life with this inventing shit. only been doing it since 16 ish lol, and after all this time; im now getting my foothold.

---

maybe TODO's:

    -Powerpoint - How, When, Step by Step.
    -Q&A from professionals.
    -BETA testing propositions and where (Military bases might be the best place to test this solution to Faster Responce times, or other citys within citys that have a rather static number cars a day and can be kept as a good test enviroment.)
    -Edge cases & solutions.
    -possible effects on traffic stability.
    -how to incentivise civilian's to follow these rules (id suggest using insurance companies, 
        if they get a photo of their licences from the first responders, a monitary fine should be sufficent, and a reward if otherwise, in this way it can be a temporary incentive until people adapt

<*> my nighbors tried to stop me from being who i was, they tried to stop me from helping others, they tried their hardest - i never give up on my dreams, i promise this dream above will be a reality and we will save lives due to it with minimal effort.

(how i hope its used) possible high level uses include:

    state/federal O/P/A killers. 
   
    amber alerts. 
   
    mass(ive) (loosers who do) shootings. 
   
    Presendial motorcades. 
   
    saving grandma (no matter the sevarity, if its a good grandma who is raising the kids, it better be use 100% of the time)
   
    containment of pathological/toxicalogical/radiological/or gov. training... for these events. 
    
    fires or fires not caused by humans
    
    tornados/hurricanes/cyclones (oh we dont have those, your country might, maybe come here and we provide better protection...) or other natural disasters.  
    
    [adding more later]

   <!> no one will be able to say they never helped the cops, presidents, feds, or their fellow man/or women, to me just for that laugh, it would be worth it - that would be really funny right? we all do something good, for the first time in society we all all doing something good for everyone else with no cost or payment to the helpers and helpies, thats some real hippy stuff 😂.

## Criminal or Medical Emergencies in Which the Seconds/Minutes Matter to Save the Lives of Others. 

*where seconds and minutes matter, along with explanations for the reasons why time is or may becritical in each case presented for this list. this is not an exhaustive list which is presented*
 _________
# Critical Medical Conditions: Immediate Interventions Required

## Cardiac Arrest
Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart stops beating, leading to a loss of blood flow to vital organs. Immediate CPR and defibrillation are crucial, as every minute without intervention decreases the likelihood of survival by about 10%. Rapid response can mean the difference between life and death.

## Severe Bleeding (Hemorrhage)
Severe bleeding from traumatic injuries can lead to hypovolemic shock and organ failure in a matter of minutes. Applying direct pressure or a tourniquet can control blood loss. The quicker the intervention, the higher the chances of survival.

## Stroke
A stroke occurs when blood flow to the brain is interrupted, causing brain cells to die. Immediate treatment can restore blood flow and minimize brain damage. The acronym FAST (Face, Arms, Speech, Time) emphasizes that time is critical; effective treatment is most beneficial within the first few hours.

## Heart Attack (Myocardial Infarction)
A heart attack occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked, causing heart muscle damage. Quick treatment, such as administering aspirin or thrombolytics, can restore blood flow and prevent further damage. Every minute counts to improve outcomes.

## Overdose
An overdose from drugs can lead to respiratory failure or cardiac arrest. Rapid administration of antidotes, such as naloxone for opioid overdoses, can reverse life-threatening effects. The sooner treatment is given, the better the chances of recovery.

## Anaphylaxis (Severe Allergic Reactions)
Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that can cause airway swelling and cardiovascular collapse. Immediate administration of epinephrine is essential; delays can lead to severe respiratory failure and death, often within minutes.

## Aneurysm Rupture
A ruptured aneurysm can cause life-threatening internal bleeding. Rapid surgical intervention is necessary to control bleeding and repair the blood vessel. Time is critical, as delays can lead to rapid deterioration and death.

## Pulmonary Embolism
A pulmonary embolism occurs when a blood clot blocks a pulmonary artery, preventing blood flow to the lungs. This condition can lead to respiratory failure and cardiac arrest. Prompt diagnosis and treatment with anticoagulants or thrombolytics are essential to improve survival.

## Severe Trauma from Vehicle Accidents
Severe trauma from accidents can result in multiple injuries, including internal bleeding and fractures. Immediate assessment and intervention are crucial to stabilize the patient and address life-threatening injuries.

## Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)
A TBI can occur from falls, accidents, or violence, leading to swelling and bleeding in the brain. Immediate imaging and surgical intervention may be necessary to prevent permanent damage or death.

## Drowning/Near Drowning
Drowning can lead to brain damage within minutes due to lack of oxygen. Prompt rescue and resuscitation efforts are crucial to restore breathing and prevent long-term complications.

## Shootings/Gunshot Wounds
Gunshot wounds can cause severe damage to organs and blood vessels. Immediate medical attention is necessary to control bleeding and prevent shock or death from injury.

## Asthma Attacks
Severe asthma attacks can cause the airways to constrict, leading to respiratory distress. Quick administration of bronchodilators is essential to relieve symptoms and restore normal breathing.

## Electrical Injuries
Electrical injuries can cause internal damage, cardiac arrest, and burns. Rapid assessment and treatment are necessary to address complications and prevent long-term injury.

## Compartment Syndrome
Compartment syndrome occurs when pressure builds up in muscle compartments, compromising blood flow. Timely intervention, such as fasciotomy, is essential to prevent permanent muscle and nerve damage.

## Ectopic Pregnancy
An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, often in a fallopian tube. If it ruptures, it can cause life-threatening internal bleeding. Immediate surgical intervention is critical to save the patient’s life.

## Ruptured Spleen
A ruptured spleen can lead to severe internal bleeding. Prompt diagnosis and surgical intervention are necessary to control the bleeding and prevent shock.

## Spinal Cord Injuries
Spinal cord injuries can lead to paralysis and loss of function if not treated quickly. Stabilizing the spine and preventing further injury are critical to improving outcomes.

## Sepsis/Septic Shock
Sepsis is a severe infection that can lead to organ failure. Rapid identification and treatment with antibiotics and fluids are essential to prevent septic shock, which can be fatal if not addressed quickly.

## Hypothermia
Hypothermia occurs when body temperature drops dangerously low. Immediate warming and medical intervention are crucial to prevent organ failure and death.

## Heatstroke
Heatstroke is a life-threatening condition caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures. Rapid cooling is necessary to prevent brain damage and other complications.

## Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)
DKA is a severe complication of diabetes characterized by high blood sugar and ketone levels. Immediate treatment with insulin and fluids is crucial to prevent life-threatening complications.

## Acute Renal Failure
Acute renal failure can occur suddenly due to various causes, leading to a build-up of toxins in the body. Prompt medical intervention can prevent complications and restore kidney function.

## Intracranial Hemorrhage
Intracranial hemorrhage involves bleeding within the skull, which can lead to brain damage. Immediate imaging and surgical intervention may be necessary to control bleeding and relieve pressure.

## Severe Burns
Severe burns can result in significant fluid loss, infection, and shock. Time-sensitive treatments, such as fluid resuscitation and infection control, are crucial to improve survival rates.

## Choking
Choking can lead to asphyxiation and loss of consciousness within minutes. Quick intervention, such as performing the Heimlich maneuver, is vital to dislodge the obstruction and restore airflow.

## Blunt Force Trauma
Blunt force trauma can cause internal injuries and bleeding. Immediate assessment and intervention are necessary to address potentially life-threatening conditions.

## Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)
ARDS is a severe lung condition that can develop rapidly and lead to respiratory failure. Immediate medical support, such as mechanical ventilation, is critical to prevent death.

## Cardiac Tamponade
Cardiac tamponade occurs when fluid builds up around the heart, restricting its ability to pump effectively. Rapid diagnosis and intervention are crucial to relieve pressure and restore heart function.

## Severe Abdominal Pain (Possible Appendicitis)
Severe abdominal pain could indicate appendicitis, which can lead to a ruptured appendix and life-threatening infection. Timely surgical intervention is necessary to prevent complications.

## Perforated Ulcer
A perforated ulcer can lead to peritonitis and sepsis. Immediate surgical intervention is critical to repair the ulcer and prevent life-threatening complications.

## Severe Dehydration
Severe dehydration can lead to organ failure and shock. Immediate rehydration with fluids is essential to restore bodily functions and prevent complications.

## Heat Exhaustion
Heat exhaustion can develop into heatstroke if not treated promptly. Quick cooling and hydration are necessary to prevent serious complications.

## Hypoglycemia (Severe Low Blood Sugar)
Severe hypoglycemia can lead to confusion, seizures, or loss of consciousness. Rapid administration of glucose is essential to restore blood sugar levels and prevent brain injury.

## Toxic Ingestion (e.g., Poisoning)
Toxic ingestion can lead to severe organ damage and life-threatening symptoms. Immediate medical attention is necessary to manage the effects of the toxin and prevent further harm.

## Acute Liver Failure
Acute liver failure can result from various causes, leading to rapid deterioration of liver function. Immediate medical intervention is necessary to address complications and potentially save the patient’s life.

## Hyperthermia
Hyperthermia occurs when the body overheats, potentially leading to heat-related illnesses. Immediate cooling measures are critical to prevent serious health consequences.

_______

# Criminal Situations Requiring Immediate Response

## Terrorist Attacks  
In cases of bombings, hostage situations, or other large-scale terror attacks, rapid response is essential to prevent further casualties and chaos. Early intervention can also stop secondary attacks and reduce mass panic.

## Active Shooter Situations  
Time is critical because the shooter is actively causing harm, and every second can mean the difference between life and death for multiple people. Immediate intervention is needed to neutralize the threat and minimize casualties.

## Arson  
Fires spread quickly, and in an arson scenario, seconds matter in preventing the loss of life and extensive property damage. Early firefighting efforts and evacuation can save lives and minimize destruction.

## Sexual Assault and/or Other, Including Rape, Sexual Harassment, Child Molestation, Sexual Exploitation, and Sexual Coercion  
Immediate response is necessary to prevent further harm to the victim and collect crucial forensic evidence. Quick action can also prevent the perpetrator from continuing their assault on other victims.

## Kidnapping  
The first few minutes or hours after a kidnapping are crucial for recovery. The longer a victim is missing, the harder it is to track their location, increasing the risk of harm to the victim.

## Hate Crimes  
Hate crimes can escalate quickly into severe violence or even murder. Early intervention prevents further harm to the targeted individual or community and sends a clear message that such actions won’t be tolerated.

## Domestic Violence  
Domestic violence can escalate in seconds, especially when emotions are running high or weapons are involved. Immediate action prevents severe injury or death of the victim, who is often in a vulnerable state.

## Armed Robbery  
Armed robbery involves immediate danger to bystanders or employees. Quick intervention prevents further violence, reduces the likelihood of hostage-taking, and may catch the perpetrator in the act.

## Home Invasions  
These situations can rapidly escalate to physical violence or murder if the homeowner confronts the intruder. Immediate police response is necessary to protect the occupants and catch the invaders.

## Assaults (Physical)  
Assaults can lead to severe injuries or death within minutes if left unchecked. Quick intervention ensures the victim receives medical attention and stops the assailant from causing further harm.

## Domestic Abuse (Escalating)  
In cases where domestic abuse is intensifying, the situation can quickly spiral into lethal violence. Fast intervention helps de-escalate tensions and safeguard the victim before the situation becomes fatal.

## Stalking with Threats of Violence  
Stalking situations can escalate into violence if the stalker decides to act on their threats. A quick response is critical to protect the victim and prevent a potentially deadly encounter.

## Bomb Threats/Explosive Devices  
Time is of the essence to evacuate people and neutralize any explosive threats. Delayed action increases the risk of casualties if the device detonates or the threat is credible.

## Hostage Situations  
The safety of hostages can deteriorate rapidly, especially if the captor becomes agitated or feels cornered. Swift negotiation and tactical intervention are vital to prevent casualties and resolve the situation peacefully.

## Suicide Attempts (Active)  
In active suicide attempts, every second matters to prevent self-harm or death. Immediate intervention can save the individual’s life and provide them with the help they need.

## Child Abductions  
The likelihood of safely recovering a child decreases as time passes. Immediate response and issuing an Amber Alert are essential to increase the chances of locating the child before they are harmed.

## Police Chases  
High-speed chases can lead to collisions, injuries, or fatalities. The sooner police can safely apprehend the fleeing suspect, the fewer lives are at risk on the road.

## Threatening Behavior with Weapons  
When someone is brandishing a weapon, they are moments away from causing potentially fatal harm. Immediate intervention helps disarm the individual and protect potential victims.

## Burglary  
Burglars may turn violent if confronted by homeowners or law enforcement. Swift action helps prevent escalation and ensures that the perpetrator is apprehended before fleeing or causing harm.

## Prison Breaks  
Escaped prisoners are often dangerous individuals, and the longer they remain free, the more likely they are to commit further crimes. Immediate capture reduces the risk of violence and protects the public.

## False Imprisonment  
False imprisonment can escalate into physical violence if the captor feels threatened or cornered. Immediate intervention helps secure the release of the victim and prevents further escalation.

## Threats of Violence  
When credible threats of violence are made, fast action prevents the individual from carrying them out. It also reassures the target of the threat that they are being protected.

## Exploitation of Vulnerable Individuals  
Vulnerable individuals, such as the elderly or those with disabilities, can be exploited quickly, leading to financial ruin or emotional trauma. Swift intervention stops further harm and brings justice.

## Identity Theft (Escalating to Threats)  
While identity theft can be financially damaging, it can escalate into threats of violence or extortion. Early intervention minimizes the damage and helps track down the perpetrator.

## Road Rage Incidents  
Road rage can turn violent in seconds, leading to physical altercations or dangerous driving behaviors. Quick police intervention prevents accidents and injuries to drivers or bystanders.

## Police Officer Involved Shootings  
In such cases, every second matters to determine if the officer or the suspect requires immediate medical attention. It also ensures a swift investigation to maintain public trust and transparency.

## Armed Carjacking
