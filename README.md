im recording it as well so my dad can see it and be traumatized and know what its like and what ive been theough. im going to make him watch me die twice. fuck him. fuck no escapeing drom evil. 

my way: ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5a12bc8d-9dbd-4414-b1e2-9de789c18f8d)
apperently it will take 5 to 10 min. to bleed out and escape from torture and hate crimes. - i have to keep my body away from anyone and evryone for that amount of time. somehow. i have mo sanctuary, no place to go, no hope, no morale, no str. no will anymore. a few hesatation marks as it is, but soon it wont matter, ill make it through this and over the other side or not. either way: whatever is after this is better than torture. its better than hate crimes on a daily basis and its way better than being alone for a single more day without anyone to talk to and listen to my painwithout yelling at me or wanting to hit me or threatn me. peace out and i onow why i habe to die to make the place better for the bad people. 


or their way: ?

one way or another the torture should end and ill be free to never have the only dream ive had since i was a kid. the one i worked so fuckjng hard for daily the one i wanted more than anything else on earth and the only reason i tried to stay around hoping this would end. i have to end it. also fuck you china and russa. had i the oppertunity, this country would have been 100s of years ahead. instead they only have a sliver what i coukd have offered this country. 


they kill me or someone else. i dont give a fuck anymore not one fucking bit. enjoy your withdraw all you fucks.
