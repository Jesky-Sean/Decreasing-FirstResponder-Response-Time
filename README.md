My Draft - and pre-release white paper.

*<!> look how well i write when im not being affected by hate crimes and sleep deprived for months on end due to hate crimes. crazy. but when im at my worst is when people get the most ammo and its often belived. god i wish i had another chance..* and the managments hate group is right back at it. fuck this place and the managemnt for how ive been treated.* 

I came up with this for someone, sorry again, seriously, i thought id impress her by just getting a nobel prize for her and our future: (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jesky-Sean/Decreasing-FirstResponder-Response-Time/refs/heads/main/ABestSolution.docx)
    (A Best Solution. by, sean m jesky, as a word document).

here i, Sean M Jesky Propose a valid and effective means of decreasing responce times for first responders to save lives on the order of 10,000 to 45,000 a year (if we can decreece Responce Time by just 3 minutes on average - without hindering traffic flow by no more thn a decimal of the pre-existing triffic flow conditions of the area in which its active, system activates a simple, temporary dynamic shifting lane system; created by citizen drivers. this is done until the system has been turned off behind the first responders, after which civilian drivers can returned back to their original lane. my idea can also results in almost no traffic being held up for long, if at all; and we can enable our first responders to acheive faster source location, to destination location responce times, safely as well for both first responders, and civilian drivers and pedestrians, its with a small group effort - without basiclly any real effort for us all to save the lives of others, and in record time too, enough to make a real difference.

    *this image shows basic rules of how it would work in action on a whiteboard. (corrected, again, again, again - and added extra notes and better look)*

    Rule #0: The FRLS (first responder lighting system) turns off after first
        responder(s) have passed the intersection(s) along their route(s).
        
    Rule #1: when active, and the FRLS is on. civilian drivers must merge into any
       inactive lane (anywhere the FRLS is not on and flashing). 
        
    Rule #2: when the FRLS is active across all lanes of a intersection, all cars
        within those lanes must remain stationary, and not move until rule #0 
        becomes true (when FRLS is off at that intersection), at which point 
        resume with regular traffic light system rules, as civilian drivers normally
        would.
       
    Rule #3: FRLS stays active until one intersection after the first
        responders destination. 

    RESULT: A temporay dynamic express lane for first responders to quickly arrive at
        their destination as to reduce casualitys that a reduction in time can
        produce, as the studies suggest is possible to save over 10,000 lives a
        year if we just reduce the responce time by one minute. we can all be apart
        of something great and there is nothing more we have to do but move left,
        right, or just a simple, temp. stop when we drive, and only for a few moments 
        of time. we, the people can all do something great for us all at no cost to 
        us all, together as a country. we can be a Utopiatarian society. we can
        achevie it if we try, together.

*finished flowchart... it think..
its easier to improve upon your provious work, than it is to improve upon nothing, its why ill put anything down even if its bad because that can be made better than, nothing created yet.  .. idk im trying to show how what i do is a purely iterative process that anyone could do.*

--if rule number two is an issue:
If the FRLS is on, civilians cannot use that lane, if it’s on, move(merge) from that lane into an inactive FRLS lane.  

--if first responders are stuck behind a set of vehicles (due to rule #2), disable FRLS infront (the lane of the First Responder being blocked by traffic - until FR (First Responder(s) has/have passed, the signal from that first/last FR's ID will tell the system, or operator to turn off the FRLS directly behind them (or when the last FR reachs the middle of the intersection), at which point civilian drivers resume traffic rules and lighting. 

--[!] if rule number two is applied at that intersection, and the FR is stuck behind the civilian vehicles in front of the FR - a special FRLS signal will trigger to signal to drivers must move until through intersection into an inactive FRLS lane to then allow the FR behind them to pass and if others are even further back it prevents collisions with FR utilizing the active lane.  
to acheive this end; The FRLS turned that is turned off for rule #2 cannot be a lane which leads into an active FRLS lane, meaning the FR must turn into a lane which doesnt turn into the active lane, they must also merge into an inactive lane to prevent accidents with other FR that may be using the active lane. 
  
  --[!] the system should also be able to stay active with a simple push of a button once a route is active (basically, in this case, the route by the closest and the meadian distance FRs or machine known to choose best route for largest volume of FRs, and as long as it provides easy/quicker access for the largest number of FR's and enable them to reach quickest and/or easiest, while outliers, the lower amount of FR's will have to travrse these routes to a rule #2 intersection section of lanes - but the majority of FR's will be enabled by the FRLS to reach a EMR location - this would happen if larger assignment by operators or system is not able to be done, but 'closest to', is able to be done by an operator-admin in a fast time, possibly due to catostrphic event(s) *occurs where a large number of FR is required, as such, they are not assigned, this makes it so they all just have to make it to a rule #2 intersection that follows the route used by the first FR in the system, then the FR's, must merge from a nonactive lane to active lane.* 

  --the last vehicle furthest from the destination and their ID hasnt been scanned yet by radio signal the relay waits, when signal is captured the signal is relayed back to the system operator which will then turn off the system behind the last FR assigined to location, if the batch dispach method is used below. 

  [!] preassigned routes to ensure a large volume of FR's no matter where they are in a disaster is located by ensuring all main roads that connect to each-other and select side-roads all have a active FRLS plan in place, so when the big button is pressed and the worst happens, no thought is requred by the operator-admin more than knowing and acting.

granted, this system of emergency lights attached to traffic light posts, or other fixtures - its pretty easy to set up and idk, it could be implemented like ten tomorrows from now if we wanted really.. if they hired someone whos like... the best at this stuff..

*these two images show concept art of how it could be implemented if we redesgined traffic lights, and we could just embedd first responder lights within traffic lights to enable this effect required to alert drivers, to merge into a new lane or come to a stop at a intersection as required based off first responders requirements based off their route, or simply attached underneath existing traffic lights and enabled by existing power source.*

*suggestions:

>   >mark streets with this system in place, so when people turn onto these streets they cant say they were surprised or say they had no idea, etc, in such areas be more mindful of space between vehicles as to allow faster merging if or when required.
>  >
>  >
>  >late merging is an issue i can foresee being an issue as well.
>  >
>  >
>  >waiting till the last moment to merge, when this needs to happen ASAP.
>  >
>  >
>  >placmsnt (hills and vallys, turns, distance from FRLS and Traffic lights to see, and other unlisted obstructions.
>  >
>  >
>  >another issue is cars that pull into a few lanes, like large trucks or even regular cars, when trying to get into a lane without the room for such a turn-in.
>   >
>   >placment in bottle necks that hinder response times like busy streets, popular areas, etc. the places that cause the most issues.
>  >
>  >
>  >Like the faster the blinking or blinking intermittently, or even with an additional color(yellowish) to indicate you have to merge within two intersections as it’s the start of the route you have to merge.  (Intersections after the first two, all the way until its destination, or get as close it it’s destination as is possible by FR’s  will (should) be completely empty from top to bottom, and will, or rather should in theory, create FR’s their own, temporary-dynamic-Emergency Response-First-Responder-Express-lane (or aka, the TDERFREL), or essentially giving our FR’s their own autobahn (but with a actual, emphasis on purposely using Horse Power - gd freedom horses -  A world changing use of them freedom horse’s. Thank you Jesus! (I hope to one day own a Ferrari or Koenigsegg and I just know one day!!!)) to save thousands of lives a year.

im just getting started in life with this inventing shit. only been doing it since 16 ish lol, and after all this time; im now getting my foothold.

maybe TODO's:

    -Powerpoint - How, When, Step by Step.
    -Q&A from professionals.
    -BETA testing propositions and where (Military bases might be the best place to test this solution to Faster Responce times, or other citys within citys that have a rather static number cars a day and can be kept as a good test enviroment.)
    -Edge cases & solutions.
    -possible effects on traffic stability.
    -how to incentivise civilian's to follow these rules (id suggest using insurance companies, 
        if they get a photo of their licences from the first responders, a monitary fine should be sufficent, and a reward if otherwise, in this way it can be a temporary incentive until people adapt

<*> my nighbors tried to stop me from being who i was, they tried to stop me from helping others, they tried their hardest - i never give up on my dreams, i promise this dream above will be a reality and we will save lives due to it with minimal effort. 

---

(how i hope its used) possible high level uses include:

    state/federal O/P/A killers. 
   
    amber alerts. 
   
    mass(ive) (loosers who do) shootings. 
   
    Presendial motorcades. 
   
    saving grandma (no matter the sevarity, if its a good grandma who is raising the kids, it better be use 100% of the time)
   
    containment of pathological/toxicalogical/radiological/or gov. training... for these events. 
    
    fires or fires not caused by humans
    
    tornados/hurricanes/cyclones (oh we dont have those, your country might, maybe come here and we provide better protection...) or other natural disasters.  
    
    [adding more later]

   <!> no one will be able to say they never helped the cops, presidents, feds, or their fellow man/or women, to me just for that laugh, it would be worth it - that would be really funny right? we all do something good, for the first time in society we all all doing something good for everyone else with no cost or payment to the helpers and helpies, thats some real hippy stuff 😂.    
   
    (never for VIPs please!... i mean, just me so i can see how it works....).
