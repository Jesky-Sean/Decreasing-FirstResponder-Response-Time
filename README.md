how im going to die:

doesnt matter. fuck this. fuck this suffering daily for no goal, incant miss what ive never had.  i csnt want for what i cant afford. i have nothing to offer it seems so it makes it easier to end my life.

im glad youve all won my life, dreams, goals, everything. congrats. im happy for you all. going to lose everything and it doesnt bother me anymore. im ready to die.
