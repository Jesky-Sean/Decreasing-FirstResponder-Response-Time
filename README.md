*<!> look how well i write when im not being affected by hate crimes and sleep deprived for months on end due to hate crimes. crazy. but when im at my worst is when people get the most ammo and its often belived. god i wish i had another chance..* and the managments hate group is right back at it. fuck this place and the managemnt for how ive been treated.*

I came up with this for someone, sorry again, seriously, i thought id impress her by just getting a nobel prize for her and our future, and the first time i told anyone was when eating ice-cream from the best place in the world; and i literlly just came up with it soon after we met, but i got caught up in my own feeling and... sorry: (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Jesky-Sean/Decreasing-FirstResponder-Response-Time/refs/heads/main/ABestSolution.docx)
    (A Best Solution. by, sean m jesky, as a word document). 

-----
-----

here i, Sean M Jesky Propose a valid and effective means of decreasing responce times for first responders to save lives on the order of 10,000 plus or minus (but! if we can decreese our nations first Responce Time by just 3 minutes on average - we can bump up the amount of lives saved to 40,000, to 45,000 lives saved a year)

this strategy occurs largly without any effort, or much at all - thiss effect on traffic flow, if any - does occur for long periods of time, if any - by no more then possibly a decimal of the pre-existing conditions - my hope is that it actually reduces averages for any such roads utilizd, if used over-time on roads where emergency responce can or could or does cause delays currently - due to various reasons like; congestion, poor road design (way better over the last decade), or other traffic related problems relating to this sytem that i havent listed. 

this systems use, its purpose is to create a: TDELFR (temporary dynamic express lane system for first responders). a TDELFR would be created by unified use and road connected with an active FREL (First Responder Express Lane) created by citizen drivers on the roads which utilize this system on the road, simply by merging to a lane (within two intersections after its activation. 

in addition; the FRLS (First Responder Lighting System), could blink with a yellow flashing light, in addition to the emergency lights to indicate to drivers that the first responder(s) just started their route, and once its done flashing yellow, it would indicate that the civilian drivers merging have no more time to merge before the next intersection. 

after two intersections, every intersection after the first two passed by first, first responder, and if its a batch-dispaching (meaning a call such as - "all units in the area"), including the very last last first responder who radios in that they are responding (meaning everyone inbetween those two first and last Responders, and those also responding inbetween those, who are responding to the secene, should be able to connect their routes together, while the FR leading the tail-end closes the FRLS's circut behind the group, meanwhile, signaling to the intersections FRLS, before the next intersection they cross along their routes, to resume traffic signals behind them, along a given route) and the lane should be wide open (clear to the end of any traffic) to their emergency destination(s) for everyone else holding up the rear of the dispach group, or those responding to the dispatcher requesting "all units in the area".    

this state of driving continues until the system has been turned off behind first responders, after which civilian drivers are returned back to their original lane, after the First Responders have passed their intersection; by doing this together, we can enable our first responders to acheive faster source location, to destination location responce times. 

this, done per the rules, will safely organize traffic and save lives with no real effort from civilians and pedestrians on the road; with no more effort added to them than traffic lighting rules regulally follwed, for both first responders, civilian drivers, and pedestrians. 

its with a small group effort this effect occurs - honestly, without basiclly any real effort for us all; we can all work towards saving the lives of others, and in record time too, enough to make a real difference as a country. no nothing, just - we the people.

btw im creating this for the police /EMS and/or the DOT to operate, not for someone else to operate, idk about that, we dont need someone whos not ever saved a life to be involved in these decisions in real time where arguing about it being needed or not would be a burden on the system (perf. the ones dispatched control this feature as to prevent it not being used when it needs to be used, basically, them saying they are responding is enough to put responcability of proper use in their hands, if they can own and use a gun, this would be hardly above that responcability; in addition, i predict, that its use will make it easier to deescalate due to FR's arriving to people before things keep becoming more escalated; also hopfully arriving in that state makes things safter for FR's and purps. and vics. in the process. more time to assess means more time to save and help others (i know what im talking about in that last sentence only, so i know the rest would also be largly true.

    *this image shows basic rules of how it would work in action on a whiteboard. (corrected, again, again, again - and added extra notes and better look)*

    Rule #0: The FRLS (first responder lighting system) turns off after first
        responder(s) have passed the intersection(s) along their route(s).
        
    Rule #1: when active, and the FRLS is on. civilian drivers must merge into any
       inactive lane (anywhere the FRLS is not on and flashing). 
        
    Rule #2: when the FRLS is active across all lanes of a intersection, all cars
        within those lanes must remain stationary, and not move until rule #0 
        becomes true (when FRLS is off at that intersection), at which point 
        resume with regular traffic light system rules, as civilian drivers normally
        would.
       
    Rule #3: FRLS stays active until one intersection after the first
        responders destination. 

    RESULT: A temporay dynamic express lane for first responders to quickly arrive at
        their destination as to reduce casualitys that a reduction in time can
        produce, as the studies suggest is possible to save over 10,000 lives a
        year if we just reduce the responce time by one minute. we can all be apart
        of something great and there is nothing more we have to do but move left,
        right, or just a simple, temp. stop when we drive, and only for a few moments 
        of time. we, the people can all do something great for us all at no cost to 
        us all, together as a country. we can be a Utopiatarian society. we can
        achevie it if we try, together.

*finished flowchart... it think..
its easier to improve upon your provious work, than it is to improve upon nothing, its why ill put anything down even if its bad because that can be made better than, nothing created yet.  .. idk im trying to show how what i do is a purely iterative process that anyone could do.*

--if rule number two is an issue:
If the FRLS is on, civilians cannot use that lane, if it’s on, move(merge) from that lane into an inactive FRLS lane.  

--if first responders are stuck behind a set of vehicles (due to rule #2), disable FRLS infront (the lane of the First Responder being blocked by traffic - until FR (First Responder(s) has/have passed, the signal from that first/last FR's ID will tell the system, or operator to turn off the FRLS directly behind them (or when the last FR reachs the middle of the intersection), at which point civilian drivers resume traffic rules and lighting. 

--[!] if rule number two is applied at that intersection, and the FR is stuck behind the civilian vehicles in front of the FR - a special FRLS signal will trigger to signal to drivers must move until through intersection into an inactive FRLS lane to then allow the FR behind them to pass and if others are even further back it prevents collisions with FR utilizing the active lane.  
to acheive this end; The FRLS turned that is turned off for rule #2 cannot be a lane which leads into an active FRLS lane, meaning the FR must turn into a lane which doesnt turn into the active lane, they must also merge into an inactive lane to prevent accidents with other FR that may be using the active lane. 
  
  --[!] the system should also be able to stay active with a simple push of a button once a route is active (basically, in this case, the route by the closest and the meadian distance FRs or machine known to choose best route for largest volume of FRs, and as long as it provides easy/quicker access for the largest number of FR's and enable them to reach quickest and/or easiest, while outliers, the lower amount of FR's will have to travrse these routes to a rule #2 intersection section of lanes - but the majority of FR's will be enabled by the FRLS to reach a EMR location - this would happen if larger assignment by operators or system is not able to be done, but 'closest to', is able to be done by an operator-admin in a fast time, possibly due to catostrphic event(s) *occurs where a large number of FR is required, as such, they are not assigned, this makes it so they all just have to make it to a rule #2 intersection that follows the route used by the first FR in the system, then the FR's, must merge from a nonactive lane to active lane.* 

  --the last vehicle furthest from the destination and their ID hasnt been scanned yet by radio signal the relay waits, when signal is captured the signal is relayed back to the system operator which will then turn off the system behind the last FR assigined to location, if the batch dispach method is used below. 

  [!] preassigned routes to ensure a large volume of FR's no matter where they are in a disaster is located by ensuring all main roads that connect to each-other and select side-roads all have a active FRLS plan in place, so when the big button is pressed and the worst happens, no thought is requred by the operator-admin more than knowing and acting.

granted, this system of emergency lights attached to traffic light posts, or other fixtures - its pretty easy to set up and idk, it could be implemented like ten tomorrows from now if we wanted really.. if they hired someone whos like... the best at this stuff..

*these two images show concept art of how it could be implemented if we redesgined traffic lights, and we could just embedd first responder lights within traffic lights to enable this effect required to alert drivers, to merge into a new lane or come to a stop at a intersection as required based off first responders requirements based off their route, or simply attached underneath existing traffic lights and enabled by existing power source.*

>  >Like the faster the blinking or blinking intermittently, or even with an additional color(yellowish) to indicate you have to merge within two intersections as it’s the start of the route you have to merge.  (Intersections after the first two, all the way until its destination, or get as close it it’s destination as is possible by FR’s  will (should) be completely empty from top to bottom, and will, or rather should in theory, create FR’s their own, temporary-dynamic-Emergency Response-First-Responder-Express-lane (or aka, the TDERFREL), or essentially giving our FR’s their own autobahn (but with a actual, emphasis on purposely using Horse Power - gd freedom horses -  A world changing use of them freedom horse’s. Thank you Jesus! (I hope to one day own a Ferrari or Koenigsegg and I just know one day!!!)) to save thousands of lives a year.

im just getting started in life with this inventing shit. only been doing it since 16 ish lol, and after all this time; im now getting my foothold.

maybe TODO's:

    -Powerpoint - How, When, Step by Step.
    -Q&A from professionals.
    -BETA testing propositions and where (Military bases might be the best place to test this solution to Faster Responce times, or other citys within citys that have a rather static number cars a day and can be kept as a good test enviroment.)
    -Edge cases & solutions.
    -possible effects on traffic stability.
    -how to incentivise civilian's to follow these rules (id suggest using insurance companies, 
        if they get a photo of their licences from the first responders, a monitary fine should be sufficent, and a reward if otherwise, in this way it can be a temporary incentive until people adapt

Medical Emergencies Where Seconds/Minutes Matter

1. **Cardiac Arrest**  
   Cardiac arrest occurs when the heart stops beating, leading to a loss of blood flow to vital organs. Immediate CPR and defibrillation are crucial, as every minute without intervention decreases the likelihood of survival by about 10%. Rapid response can mean the difference between life and death.

2. **Severe Bleeding (Hemorrhage)**  
   Severe bleeding from traumatic injuries can lead to hypovolemic shock and organ failure in a matter of minutes. Applying direct pressure or a tourniquet can control blood loss. The quicker the intervention, the higher the chances of survival.

3. **Stroke**  
   A stroke occurs when blood flow to the brain is interrupted, causing brain cells to die. Immediate treatment can restore blood flow and minimize brain damage. The acronym FAST (Face, Arms, Speech, Time) emphasizes that time is critical; effective treatment is most beneficial within the first few hours.

4. **Heart Attack (Myocardial Infarction)**  
   A heart attack occurs when blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked, causing heart muscle damage. Quick treatment, such as administering aspirin or thrombolytics, can restore blood flow and prevent further damage. Every minute counts to improve outcomes.

5. **Overdose**  
   An overdose from drugs can lead to respiratory failure or cardiac arrest. Rapid administration of antidotes, such as naloxone for opioid overdoses, can reverse life-threatening effects. The sooner treatment is given, the better the chances of recovery.

6. **Anaphylaxis (Severe Allergic Reactions)**  
   Anaphylaxis is a life-threatening allergic reaction that can cause airway swelling and cardiovascular collapse. Immediate administration of epinephrine is essential; delays can lead to severe respiratory failure and death, often within minutes.

7. **Aneurysm Rupture**  
   A ruptured aneurysm can cause life-threatening internal bleeding. Rapid surgical intervention is necessary to control bleeding and repair the blood vessel. Time is critical, as delays can lead to rapid deterioration and death.

8. **Pulmonary Embolism**  
   A pulmonary embolism occurs when a blood clot blocks a pulmonary artery, preventing blood flow to the lungs. This condition can lead to respiratory failure and cardiac arrest. Prompt diagnosis and treatment with anticoagulants or thrombolytics are essential to improve survival.

9. **Severe Trauma from Vehicle Accidents**  
   Severe trauma from accidents can result in multiple injuries, including internal bleeding and fractures. Immediate assessment and intervention are crucial to stabilize the patient and address life-threatening injuries.

10. **Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)**  
    A TBI can occur from falls, accidents, or violence, leading to swelling and bleeding in the brain. Immediate imaging and surgical intervention may be necessary to prevent permanent damage or death.

11. **Drowning/Near Drowning**  
    Drowning can lead to brain damage within minutes due to lack of oxygen. Prompt rescue and resuscitation efforts are crucial to restore breathing and prevent long-term complications.

12. **Shootings/Gunshot Wounds**  
    Gunshot wounds can cause severe damage to organs and blood vessels. Immediate medical attention is necessary to control bleeding and prevent shock or death from injury.

13. **Asthma Attacks**  
    Severe asthma attacks can cause the airways to constrict, leading to respiratory distress. Quick administration of bronchodilators is essential to relieve symptoms and restore normal breathing.

14. **Electrical Injuries**  
    Electrical injuries can cause internal damage, cardiac arrest, and burns. Rapid assessment and treatment are necessary to address complications and prevent long-term injury.

15. **Compartment Syndrome**  
    Compartment syndrome occurs when pressure builds up in muscle compartments, compromising blood flow. Timely intervention, such as fasciotomy, is essential to prevent permanent muscle and nerve damage.

16. **Ectopic Pregnancy**  
    An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized egg implants outside the uterus, often in a fallopian tube. If it ruptures, it can cause life-threatening internal bleeding. Immediate surgical intervention is critical to save the patient’s life.

17. **Ruptured Spleen**  
    A ruptured spleen can lead to severe internal bleeding. Prompt diagnosis and surgical intervention are necessary to control the bleeding and prevent shock.

18. **Spinal Cord Injuries**  
    Spinal cord injuries can lead to paralysis and loss of function if not treated quickly. Stabilizing the spine and preventing further injury are critical to improving outcomes.

19. **Sepsis/Septic Shock**  
    Sepsis is a severe infection that can lead to organ failure. Rapid identification and treatment with antibiotics and fluids are essential to prevent septic shock, which can be fatal if not addressed quickly.

20. **Hypothermia**  
    Hypothermia occurs when body temperature drops dangerously low. Immediate warming and medical intervention are crucial to prevent organ failure and death.

21. **Heatstroke**  
    Heatstroke is a life-threatening condition caused by prolonged exposure to high temperatures. Rapid cooling is necessary to prevent brain damage and other complications.

22. **Diabetic Ketoacidosis (DKA)**  
    DKA is a severe complication of diabetes characterized by high blood sugar and ketone levels. Immediate treatment with insulin and fluids is crucial to prevent life-threatening complications.

23. **Acute Renal Failure**  
    Acute renal failure can occur suddenly due to various causes, leading to a build-up of toxins in the body. Prompt medical intervention can prevent complications and restore kidney function.

24. **Intracranial Hemorrhage**  
    Intracranial hemorrhage involves bleeding within the skull, which can lead to brain damage. Immediate imaging and surgical intervention may be necessary to control bleeding and relieve pressure.

25. **Severe Burns**  
    Severe burns can result in significant fluid loss, infection, and shock. Time-sensitive treatments, such as fluid resuscitation and infection control, are crucial to improve survival rates.

26. **Choking**  
    Choking can lead to asphyxiation and loss of consciousness within minutes. Quick intervention, such as performing the Heimlich maneuver, is vital to dislodge the obstruction and restore airflow.

27. **Blunt Force Trauma**  
    Blunt force trauma can cause internal injuries and bleeding. Immediate assessment and intervention are necessary to address potentially life-threatening conditions.

28. **Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)**  
    ARDS is a severe lung condition that can develop rapidly and lead to respiratory failure. Immediate medical support, such as mechanical ventilation, is critical to prevent death.

29. **Cardiac Tamponade**  
    Cardiac tamponade occurs when fluid builds up around the heart, restricting its ability to pump effectively. Rapid diagnosis and intervention are crucial to relieve pressure and restore heart function.

30. **Severe Abdominal Pain (Possible Appendicitis)**  
    Severe abdominal pain could indicate appendicitis, which can lead to a ruptured appendix and life-threatening infection. Timely surgical intervention is necessary to prevent complications.

31. **Perforated Ulcer**  
    A perforated ulcer can lead to peritonitis and sepsis. Immediate surgical intervention is critical to repair the ulcer and prevent life-threatening complications.

32. **Severe Dehydration**  
    Severe dehydration can lead to organ failure and shock. Immediate rehydration with fluids is essential to restore bodily functions and prevent complications.

33. **Heat Exhaustion**  
    Heat exhaustion can develop into heatstroke if not treated promptly. Quick cooling and hydration are necessary to prevent serious complications.

34. **Hypoglycemia (Severe Low Blood Sugar)**  
    Severe hypoglycemia can lead to confusion, seizures, or loss of consciousness. Rapid administration of glucose is essential to restore blood sugar levels and prevent brain injury.

35. **Toxic Ingestion (e.g., Poisoning)**  
    Toxic ingestion can lead to severe organ damage and life-threatening symptoms. Immediate medical attention is necessary to manage the effects of the toxin and prevent further harm.

36. **Acute Liver Failure**  
    Acute liver failure can result from various causes, leading to rapid deterioration of liver function. Immediate medical intervention is necessary to address complications and potentially save the patient’s life.

37. **Hyperthermia**  
    Hyperthermia occurs when the body overheats, potentially leading to heat-related illnesses. Immediate cooling measures are critical to prevent serious health consequences.

and crimes where every second and minute also matter:


## Criminal or Otherwise Emergencies Where Seconds/Minutes Matter

Here’s the reordered list of criminal situations where seconds and minutes matter, along with explanations for why time is critical in each case:

1. **Active Shooter Situations**  
   Time is critical because the shooter is actively causing harm, and every second can mean the difference between life and death for multiple people. Immediate intervention is needed to neutralize the threat and minimize casualties.

2. **Terrorist Attacks**  
   In cases of bombings, hostage situations, or other large-scale terror attacks, rapid response is essential to prevent further casualties and chaos. Early intervention can also stop secondary attacks and reduce mass panic.

3. **Arson**  
   Fires spread quickly, and in an arson scenario, seconds matter in preventing the loss of life and extensive property damage. Early firefighting efforts and evacuation can save lives and minimize destruction.

4. **Sexual Assault and/or Other, Including Rape, Sexual Harassment, Child Molestation, Sexual Exploitation, and Sexual Coercion**  
   Immediate response is necessary to prevent further harm to the victim and collect crucial forensic evidence. Quick action can also prevent the perpetrator from continuing their assault on other victims.

5. **Kidnapping**  
   The first few minutes or hours after a kidnapping are crucial for recovery. The longer a victim is missing, the harder it is to track their location, increasing the risk of harm to the victim.

6. **Hate Crimes**  
   Hate crimes can escalate quickly into severe violence or even murder. Early intervention prevents further harm to the targeted individual or community and sends a clear message that such actions won’t be tolerated.

7. **Domestic Violence**  
   Domestic violence can escalate in seconds, especially when emotions are running high or weapons are involved. Immediate action prevents severe injury or death of the victim, who is often in a vulnerable state.

8. **Armed Robbery**  
   Armed robbery involves immediate danger to bystanders or employees. Quick intervention prevents further violence, reduces the likelihood of hostage-taking, and may catch the perpetrator in the act.

9. **Home Invasions**  
   These situations can rapidly escalate to physical violence or murder if the homeowner confronts the intruder. Immediate police response is necessary to protect the occupants and catch the invaders.

10. **Carjackings**  
    Carjackings can turn violent quickly, especially if the victim resists or has passengers inside the vehicle. Fast police response is crucial to prevent harm and apprehend the perpetrator before they escape.

11. **Assaults (Physical)**  
    Assaults can lead to severe injuries or death within minutes if left unchecked. Quick intervention ensures the victim receives medical attention and stops the assailant from causing further harm.

12. **Domestic Abuse (Escalating)**  
    In cases where domestic abuse is intensifying, the situation can quickly spiral into lethal violence. Fast intervention helps de-escalate tensions and safeguard the victim before the situation becomes fatal.

13. **Stalking with Threats of Violence**  
    Stalking situations can escalate into violence if the stalker decides to act on their threats. A quick response is critical to protect the victim and prevent a potentially deadly encounter.

14. **Bomb Threats/Explosive Devices**  
    Time is of the essence to evacuate people and neutralize any explosive threats. Delayed action increases the risk of casualties if the device detonates or the threat is credible.

15. **Hostage Situations**
