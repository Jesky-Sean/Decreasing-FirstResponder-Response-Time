how far do you have to be pushed to give up each and every dream youvr ever had in the hope of getting rest? ill show everyone so you dont have to guess. fuck you all and im glad my death is something you all seem to be onboard with. 



doors unlocked as well. im ready to die or be taken. i dont care which i dont know whats real after this abuse. so thats that. 

i dont want my work going to saving lives anymore, i hope those are destroyed before anyone gets to them, fuck off world. good luck. im so happy that im ready to die, after this long of being tortured, and being finally ready. feels fucking fantastic.  

thanks for nothing world. enjoy your hate and anger. 


how im going to die:(slitting my throat and getting a cop, SWAT, or neighbors to shoot me) 

doesnt matter. fuck this. fuck this suffering daily for no goal, incant miss what ive never had.  i csnt want for what i cant afford. i have nothing to offer it seems so it makes it easier to end my life. 


no joke. look on my back poarch. its all there. anyone can get it its there. 

im glad youve all won my life, dreams, goals, everything. congrats. im happy for you all. going to lose everything and it doesnt bother me anymore. im ready to die.
